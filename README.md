# <Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
- Taking this bootcamp to learn how to code so I can eventually become a software engineer.
- The project was built as a learning guide to assist me as I build upon these basics.
- Creating this website solved the problem of not having exposure to the tools that will be used in the class.
- I learnt how to navigate through, Gitbash, github, VS code, and basics on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
